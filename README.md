# DataEngineerPythonPractice

This repository is the place for me to practice and improve my Python Programing to help me to change position Data Engineer

Almost the practice here I will follow the Python 3 path in Pluralsight

## Entry-Level

### Python 3: The big pictures
[Reference](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/python-3-big-picture/table-of-contents)

**Why Python?**
- Simple to learn
- Simple to use
- Greate community
- Widely used
- In high demand

**What is Python?**
- Syntax with space
- General-purpose and High-Level Programing Language
- Multi-paradigm (Structure, Functional, Object Oriented Programing)
- Interpreted
- Garbage-collected (No tedious memory bookeeping, Avoid common memory leaks, prevent whole classes of security issues, Efficiently implement certein persistent data structures)
- Dynamically-typed

**Python Pros and Cons**
**Pros**
- Comprehensive Standard Library
- Community-driven
- 3rd Party Libraries
- 3rd Party Tools
**Cons**
- Interpreted: Slow
- Not Native: High memory usage lack of native security sandbox
- Dynamic: Runtime errors

## Practitioner

### Classes and Object-oriented Programming in Python 3

**Should you utilize object-oriented programing**
- Not the best choice for all types of projects
- Greate way to split your code in smaller logical units
- OOP paradigm is implemented in a lot of other programing languages
- Model your code around real-world entities
